## AccountV3
Account version 3 is a smart contract that creates Token Bound Accounts for NFTs. In addition to the features that existed on the version 2, the accountv3 has new features that enhances the functionality of the TBA, which enables more secure and seamless transactions on the TokenBound Account.

### Distinct differences between TokenBound AccountV2 and AccountV3
 The Tokenbound AccountV2 has features that would allow to get account, create account, check account deployment, execute transactions on the TBA, lock account, check if account is_locked, get owner of the TBA, get ownerNft, transferERC20, TransferNFT, and  signer messages.

 The AccountV3 which is an upgraded version of the TBA has a feature that allow for accountV3 implementation,  signitory feature which checks for a valid signer and a valid signature,  executable feature which allows for transaction execution on the TBA, upgradeable feature to be able to upgrade the TBA, lockable feature which allows the account to be locked and unlocked, and  permissionable which enable the owner to allow permissioned addresses to carry out certain functions on its behalf.
 Each of these features and their functionlities are explained in details below.

### Functions

#### Constructor
The constructor function initializes certain parameters that will be executed once when the contract is deployed.

```
    fn constructor(
        ref self: ContractState,
        token_contract: ContractAddress,
        token_id: u256,
        registry: ContractAddress,
        implementation_hash: felt252,
        salt: felt252
    );
    
```
    
#####  Parameters
|    Name                |   Type              | Description  |
|------------------------|---------------------|--------------

  ######              ACCOUNTV3 IMPLEMENTATION
  
####   on_erc721_received 
  This function is called to check the receipt of an NFT. It ensures that the ERC-721 token being transferred is not a token to which the account is already bound, in other to avoid account ownership cycle.
  
```
    fn on_erc721_received(
            self: @ContractState,
            operator: ContractAddress,
            from: ContractAddress,
            token_id: u256,
            data: Span<felt252>
        ) -> felt252;
```
        
#####  Parameters
|    Name                 |      Type            |  Description  |
|-------------------------|----------------------|--------------
| `self`                  |   `ContractState `   | An instance of the TBA contract             |
| `operator`              |   `ContractAddress`  | The address that sent the NFT.                   |
| `from`                  |   `ContractAddress`  | The address of the caller of`safe_transfer_from`.|
| `token_id`              |   `u256 `            | The NFT token ID being transferred.              |
| `data`                  |   `Span<felt252>`    | Additional data of the NFT.                      |
    

#### Context
Context gives deployment details of the TBA. It is used in cases of cross interaction.

```
    fn context(self: @ContractState) -> (ContractAddress, felt252, felt252)
```

 ######         SIGNATORY IMPLEMENTATION
 
#### is_valid_signer
This function checks if the signer's contract address passed is the NFT owner's address,or permissioned address.

```
    fn is_valid_signer(self: @ContractState, signer: ContractAddress) -> bool;
    
```  
 
#### is_valid_signature
It checks if the signature is valid and returns `starknet::valid` and returns `starknet::invalid` if the signature is invalid.

```
    `fn is_valid_signature(
            self: @ContractState, hash: felt252, signature: Span<felt252>
        ) -> felt252;`
```        


    
######    EXECUTABLE IMPLEMENTATION

#### Execute
This function executes transactions on the TokenBound  account. It must be called by `is_valid_signer` and the account must not be locked.

```
    fn execute(ref self: ContractState, mut calls: Array<Call>) -> Array<Span<felt252>>;
```
 
    
######   UPGRADEABLE IMPLEMENTATION

#### upgrade
 It upgrades the Token Bound Account by taking a `new_class_hash` and replacing it with the previous `class_hash`. An account can only be upgraded by the owner and the upgrade can not be done when the account is locked.
 
```
    fn upgrade(ref self: ContractState, new_class_hash: ClassHash);
```
    
######     LOCKABLE IMPLEMENTATION
    
#### lock
 Locks an account within a specified period of time which is measured in seconds. the function can only be called by`is_valid_signer`.
 
```
    fn lock(ref self: ContractState, lock_until: u64)
```
   
#### is_locked
  checks if an account is locked and returns true if it is locked and false if it is not. If the account is locked, it returns the time left until the account is unlocked.
  
```
    fn is_locked(self: @ContractState) -> (bool, u64);
```
    
######     PERMISSIONABLE IMPLEMENTATION
    
####  set_permission
 It sets permission for an account by specifying addresses that are allowed to carryout certain function calls for the owner.
  
```
    fn set_permission(
            ref self: ContractState,
            permissioned_addresses: Array<ContractAddress>,
            permissions: Array<bool>
        );
``` 
    
#####  Parameters

| `permissions`           |  `Array<bool>`            | Values of permissions for `permissioned_addresses`.   |

    
####  has_permission
 Checks if the `contractaddress` passed is a `permissioned_address` by the owner. It returns true if permission has been set  for the Address, else it returns false.
    
```
    fn has_permission(
            self: @ContractState, owner: ContractAddress, permissioned_address: ContractAddress
        ) -> bool; 
```
